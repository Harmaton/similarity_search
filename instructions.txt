Instructions for Frontend 

This document provides an overview of how to interact with the chatbot API. 

1. API Base URL: 
   
   Once the backend server is running, it will be available at `http://localhost:8000/` if you're running it locally. For a deployed server, replace `http://localhost:8000/` with the appropriate base URL.

2. Endpoints:

   /ask?query=<your query>

   This is a GET request that takes a `query` parameter. The query is the question you want to ask the chatbot.

3. Example Usage:

   To use this endpoint, append your question to the URL. For example:

   http://localhost:8000/ask?query=What%20is%20the%20weather%20like%20today?

   Note: The question part of the URL needs to be URL encoded. In JavaScript, you can use the built-in `encodeURIComponent()` function to achieve this.

4. Response:

   The response from the server will be in JSON format. Here is an example response:

   {
       "answer": "The weather today is sunny with a high of 85 degrees."
   }

   The `answer` key contains the chatbot's response to your query.
